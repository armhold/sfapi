This is an unofficial API for Stockfighter (https://www.stockfighter.io), implemented in Golang.

I **highly recommend** [vendoring](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories) this code if you plan to use it,
as I make no promises about maintaining backward compatibility from the master branch.

I'm very happy to consider pull requests if you think you can improve the code.
